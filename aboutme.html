		This is a short video for introducing myself. It is about my personal information and hobby and interests.</p>

		<h3><img class="imgfloatL" src="photo.jpg" alt="my photo" height="50%" width="50%"> I was born and raised in China. In February 2020, I moved to the United States of America. Different cultures and languages gave me a new feeling of life. The world is diverse and I would like to pursue the things I like. I like multimedia and enjoy creating things. So I decided to attend college to learn some knowledge to support my dream. I attend CMP(Chinatown Manpower Program), which is a government program to assist new immigrants to learn English and apply for college. I have learned basic computer skills and language there, as well as met many kind and friendly guys. One of my teachers recommends applying for LaGuardia Community College. After I research this college, I felt like that the New Media Technology Major is fit my dream. There is no doubt that I join the LaGuardia family. Due to the pandemic, I have online classes for two semesters. Itâ€™s truly lonely sometimes because of the reduction of communicating with other people in person, but conversely, I have more time to think about my future life and learn how to study by myself. Anyway, I hope everything would come to normalcy.</h3>
