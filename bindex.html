				<h2>Why do I like this book?</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>The special narrative method that creates imagination space for readers</h3>
				<article class="tcolor-change1">
					<p>
						The whole book serves Nick as the narrator, guiding me to understand the development of the story through Nick's perspective. As a specific character in the story, Nick promotes the development of the plot and gives me a sense of reality. At the same time, he maintains a cold-eyed and sober attitude to narrate the story. It is objective and reasonable which is very attractive to me. Nick's dual identity not only closes the distance with me. He is like an old friend telling you about his past. What’s more, his inner activities also lead me to gradually deepen the theme of the novel.

						<b>Fitzgerald</b> deliberately broke the chronological order, using flashbacks and interspersed narrative techniques to create a very mysterious feeling. Especially in the introduction to Gatsby, he did not introduce Gatsby's identity or appearance in detail, but left a lot of clues and foreshadowing for my imagination. And it will give me a feeling of solving puzzles when I read it. According to the clues given by the author, I will solve my questions step by step and approach the truth gradually. Finally, when the truth is revealed In front of me, there will be a sudden sense of openness in my heart. Then the next step is to marvel at how delicate the author's foreshadowing is.

				<h3>The theme of the fiction is thought-provoking</h3>
				<article class="tcolor-change1">
					<p>
						The great Gatsby talks about the fragmentation of the <strong>American dream</strong>, showing the insurmountable <strong>gap between different classes</strong>. At that time, the American Dream referred to a belief that people, regardless of their origin, can realize their dreams through hard work. Gatsby is a person who pursues the American dream. He was born in a poor family, but he has his own beliefs and goals.  he wants to change his life. There is no doubt that he has been working hard for his dreams. However, reality has taught him a lot and forced him to pass. He finally got a lot of wealth through improper means. He started to hold various parties, kept appearing in the eyes of the public, and became the focus of public attention and a mysterious legendary person. However, he held various parties every night in order to wait for her ever lover--Daisy. He always pursued his dream purely. Daisy symbolizing the rich statue. I think Gatsby does not love Daisy that much. In other words, he loves his dreamed Dasiy. He just takes Daisy as a symbol of his real entry into the upper-class society and breaking the social class. But at the end of the story, Gatsby still couldn't break the unbreakable class gap. The novel exposed the reality of the United States bloody but thought-provoking.

				<h3>The Charm of the Character Gatsby</h3>
				<article class="tcolor-change1">
					<p>
						Gatsby has a strong sense of goal and execution. He is pretentious and strictly manages himself. Through his own efforts and actions, he has gone through hardships and finally reached the peak of wealth. He is always working towards his dreams and goals. He bravely performed on the battlefield. He is strict with himself and lives strictly according to the scheduled day after day. He was devoted, except for Daisy, who didn't love other women. He is generous and pursues fairness. He is always awake, not indulging in great wealth. He is full of romanticism and waited for a woman for many years. He is a fictional person who exists in the novel because, in reality, almost no one can be like him.
